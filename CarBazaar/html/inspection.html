            <th>Signs</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Wheel alignment and suspension issues</th>
            <th>If the vehicle pulls to one side of the road, or if it wanders back and forth when it should be going straight, 
                that’s a problem. It can be caused by improper alignment settings or worn suspension components. If it makes a crashing 
                sound when you hit a bump or pothole, the shock absorbers could need replacing.
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Steering Issues</th>
            <th>These include excessive play in the wheel from worn steering components, or difficulty turning the wheel due 
                to problems with the power steering.
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Braking issues</th>
            <th>These can include vibration or shaking during braking, usually due to warped brake rotors. Having to apply excessive 
                force to the brake pedal usually indicates a problem with the brake assist system. Squealing or chirping may indicate 
                glazed rotors or other problems with brake components.
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Engine issues</th>
            <th>The engine should idle and accelerate smoothly, and run at a normal temperature without overheating. </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Transmission issues</th>
            <th>Transmission can get expensive quickly, so the inspector will want to make sure it shifts smoothly and 
                shows no signs of slipping. If it’s a manual, the clutch should be in good condition.
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Noises</th>
            <th>Cars can make a whole range of noises, and they can come from a variety of sources and indicate many different 
                problems. Squeaks and rattles can be caused by loose or rubbing interior panels. Wind noises can be caused by 
                misaligned windows or worn seals. Clunks and rattling can indicate loose or broken vehicle component mounts, 
                among other things.
